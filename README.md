Business Intelligence Reporting for Wide World Importers

Description:
As part of an academic project, I developed comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) solutions for Wide World Importers, a wholesale novelty goods importer and distributor operating from the San Francisco Bay Area. The project was divided into two parts:

1. SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) Report:
Created a detailed Monthly-Yearly Sales Report for the state of California using SQL Server Reporting Services. This report provided insights into the sales trends over multiple years, highlighting monthly and yearly sales figures. The project involved restoring and utilizing the WideWorldImportersDW database, querying the data to generate sales reports, and formatting them for clear presentation to business stakeholders.

2. Data Analytics and BI Report:
Explored the data warehouse schema of Wide World Importers and developed a data mart using SQL Server Analysis Services and Power BI. Conducted in-depth data analysis to uncover actionable insights for the business management team. The analysis focused on sales performance, stock management, and logistics efficiency. I utilized Power BI’s visuals and dashboards, as well as Excel’s BI features such as pivot tables and charts, to present findings. The final report was crafted for the senior management, including the CEO, providing data-driven recommendations to enhance operational efficiency and support strategic decision-making.
